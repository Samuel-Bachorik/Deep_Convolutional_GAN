# MNIST_Deep-Convolutional_GAN
Neural network generating hand written numbers <br/>

Custom model trained with custom data loader <br/>
# Model
   -  Fully convolutional, no Linear (Fully contected) layers
   -  Generator with 6x TransposeConv, batchnorm, ReLu activation
   -  Discriminator with 6x Conv2d, batchnorm, Leaky ReLu activation with 0.2 negative_slope
   -  Xavier weight init
   -  Zero bias init
   -  Trained on NVIDIA RTX 3060


# Loss function
Instead of the usual BCE function, I used BCEWithLogitsLoss for better numerical stability. <br/>
Loss formula -<br/>

### The course of the loss function
From this figure we can see that 50 epoch is enough for these models. Generator can not get any better. <br/>
For better results you should try wasserstein loss for example. But i think for this aplication this is enough<br/>
